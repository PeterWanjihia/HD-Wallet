# 🚀 HD Wallet Generator

## Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet Implementation in C

This project is a **from-scratch implementation** of a Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet based on **BIP-39** (mnemonic phrases) and **BIP-32** (key derivation) standards, with Ethereum address generation support.

---

### 🔧 Features

- ✅ Generate secure mnemonic phrases (BIP-39)
- ✅ Convert mnemonics to seeds using PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512
- ✅ Derive master and child keys (BIP-32 hardened & non-hardened)
- ✅ Generate Ethereum addresses from derived keys
- ✅ Designed for security, transparency, and educational clarity

---

### 🎯 Why This Project

**HD wallets are the backbone of blockchain key management.**

This implementation serves to:

- Deepen understanding of wallet internals and cryptographic standards  
- Provide a minimal, auditable alternative to heavy libraries  
- Enable integration into blockchain tools, signing modules, and research projects

---

### 🚀 Usage

> **Build instructions and CLI usage coming soon.**

---

### 🛠️ Planned Extensions

- ✅ Offline transaction signing (Ethereum ECDSA)
- ✅ CLI tool for interactive wallet management
- ✅ Library packaging for integration in other C, Rust, or Node.js projects

---

### ⚠️ Disclaimer

**For educational and research purposes only.**  
Do not use this implementation to manage real funds without rigorous security audits.
